  "Start a repl session either with the current project or standalone.

This will launch an nREPL server behind the scenes that reply will connect to.
If a :repl-port key is present in project.clj, that port will be used for the
server, otherwise it is chosen randomly. If you run this command inside of a
project, it will be run in the context of that classpath. If the command is
run outside of a project, it'll be standalone and the classpath will be
that of Leiningen."
